# scoplayer-to-pdf
This chrome extension generated PDF files from non-standard PDF viewers (mostly used by schools), 
these non-standard viewers don't allow downloading the whole PDF that is being viewed. This tool solves that problem.


## Installation
1. Download this repo with *Clone or download*, and unpack the downloaded zip.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable developer mode in the top right corner.
4. Use *Load unpacked extension* to select the unpacked folder you downloaded at step 1.
5. Navigate to a PDF viewer and press the extension icon at the top right.
